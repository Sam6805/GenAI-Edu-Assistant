≫ GenAI-Edu-Assistant

An AI-powered educational assistant that enables students to ask questions from PDF-based study materials and receive accurate, mode-based answers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Generative AI.

≫ Overview

GenAI-Edu-Assistant is designed to simplify learning from large educational documents such as textbooks and notes. Instead of manually searching through PDFs, users can upload documents, ask natural language questions, and receive context-aware answers tailored to their learning needs.

The system combines document retrieval, prompt compression, and AI-based response generation to deliver efficient and accurate results.

≫ Key Features:

1. PDF-based Question Answering
Upload educational PDFs and ask questions directly from the content.

2. Mode-based Responses
Choose how answers are generated:

  a. Default – Standard explanation

  b. Exam – Structured, exam-oriented answers

  c. Summary – Concise responses

  d. ELI5 – Simple explanations

  e. Creative – Intuitive and creative answers

3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieves only the most relevant document chunks before generating answers.

4. Context Compression (ScaleDown API)
Reduces prompt size while preserving meaning, improving performance and lowering costs.

5. Question History Tracking
View previously asked questions for better learning continuity.

6. Clean Web Interface
Simple UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

≫ Tech Stack:

1. Backend: Python, FastAPI

2. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

3. AI & NLP: OpenAI API, LangChain

4. Vector Store: FAISS

5. Embeddings: Sentence Transformers

6. Prompt Compression: ScaleDown API

≫ Working Methodology:

--User uploads a PDF document

--Text is extracted and chunked

--Relevant chunks are retrieved using vector similarity

--Context is compressed using ScaleDown

--AI generates an answer based on selected mode

--Answer is displayed on the UI and stored in history
